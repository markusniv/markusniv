### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markus, welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 2nd year IT engineer student at [Metropolia UAS](https://www.metropolia.fi/en), majoring in **mobile development**.

I'm mostly passionate about mobile and web development, and you'll be mostly seeing various mobile and web projects here. I'm currently focusing on honing my skills in **Kotlin**(:heart:) and Android development in general, as well as web development with Node.js and React.
