### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markus, welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 2nd IT engineer student at [Metropolia UAS](https://www.metropolia.fi/en), majoring in **mobile development**.

Mobile development has quickly turned into a passion of mine, and you'll be mostly seeing various mobile projects here. I'm currently focusing on honing my skills mostly in **Kotlin**(:heart:) and Android development in general.
