### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Markus, welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 2nd year IT engineer student at [Metropolia UAS](https://www.metropolia.fi/en), majoring in **mobile development**.

I'm mostly passionate about mobile development, and you'll be mostly seeing projects regarding that in here. Currently focusing on honing my skills in both web and mobile development with JavaScript (React / React Native) as well as native Android development in Kotlin.
